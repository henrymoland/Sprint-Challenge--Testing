 1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?<br>

    Describe groups together related tests in one "test suite". 

    it() is an alias of test(). The it() global is commonly used to state imperative claims about what code "should" do. <br>

2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?<br>

   TDD is test driven development. We write the test before we write the code. This allow us to achieve both good quality code and good test coverage.
   I think its a good tool to make sure you are writing good code and making sure everyingthing is functioning the way it supposed too. But for me it just make more sense to code first and then test the app.

3.  Mention three types of automated tests.<br>
    * Unit Tests
    * Component Tests
    * Integration Tests
